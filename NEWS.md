## [1.0.0] - 2023-07-04

### Changed

* Globally, the functions which use 2 workspaces now have 2 arguments `ws_from` and `ws_to` which designate the workspace which contains the updated data (`ws_from`) and the workspace to update (`ws_to`). The arguments are in that order.

    * `transfer_series`
    * `replace_series`
    * `update_metadata`
    * `update_metadata_roughly`
    * `set_metadata` for SA ITEM
* the function `replace_series` has an new argument `mp_from_name` and `mp_to_name` to specify the multipreprocessing in which to search for series
