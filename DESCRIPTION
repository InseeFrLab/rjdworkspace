Description: Set of tools to manipulate the 'JDemetra+' workspaces.  Based
    on the 'RJDemetra' package (which interfaces with version 2 of the
    'JDemetra+' (<https://github.com/jdemetra/jdemetra-app>), the seasonal
    adjustment software officially recommended to the members of the
    European Statistical System (ESS) and the European System of Central
    Banks).  This package provides access to additional workspace
    manipulation functions such as metadata manipulation, raw paths and
    wrangling of several workspaces simultaneously.  These additional
    functionalities are useful as part of a CVS data production chain.
